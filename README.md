# WhatsApp-Chat-Analyzer

This project utilizes a variety of data to comprehensively analyze each WhatsApp conversation. This includes extracting, cleaning, and processing a data frame created by splitting chats on a pattern recognized using regular expressions. Additionally, useful visualizations, such as word clouds, monthly/daily analysis, and heat maps are created using matplotlib, pandas, and seaborn in order to present a comprehensive overview of 10+ key statistics. Furthermore, a GUI with Streamlit is architected to provide an intuitive representation of the large amount of data. Ultimately, this project is designed to provide an in-depth understanding of WhatsApp conversations.
